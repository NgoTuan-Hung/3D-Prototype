- how can i tell the ai to stop for a while when it is about to use the charge skill
- ai should only use skill when it should
- can we give hint about skill in code ??
- they both modify the same variable move 


--Some mistake:
+ Be careful of pass by reference in coroutine


,
        {
            "skillName": "SwordSkill",
            "subSkillName": "SwordSkillThousandSword",
            "functionName": "Trigger",
            "keybind":"2"
        }
